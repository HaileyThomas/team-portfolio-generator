- This Work Team Portfolio Generator is a tool so that anyone could create a nice looking team portfolio without any coding knowledge- it does the work for you!
- Now we can have a website with all of our employees in one place. Just answer a few questions and open the new index.html file in your browser!
- Some problems I ran into while creating this project were the new concepts we learned of deconstructing and filtering arrays. It was definitely a challenge but at the end of the project I feel much more confident in these skills. There are so many array methods its overwhelming at first but then really exciting!
